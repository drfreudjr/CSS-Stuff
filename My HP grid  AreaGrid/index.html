            <p>University of California trained in all aspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistical analysis, oral and written scientific communication. Academic interests are attention, saccadic eye movements, consciousness, machine learning, and evolutionary approaches to human behavior. I bring all these principles to enhance effectiveness of both graphic design and interactivity.
