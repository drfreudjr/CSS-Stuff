            <p>Twenty years expertise researching attention, saccadic eye movements, visual and auditory perception, and the evolution of human behavior and consciousness. My dissertation examined the relation between attention and eye movements; subsequent publications have examined the effect on eye-gaze location on auditory speech processing, etc.. University of California trained in all aspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistical analysis, and scientific communication. I integrate these principles with regard to both aesthetic and interactive aspects of design. </p>
