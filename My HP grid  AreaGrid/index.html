            <p>University of California trained in all aspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistics, and scientific communication. Academic interests are attention, saccadic eye movements, consciousness, machine learning, and evolutionary approaches to human behavior. Enjoy applying these principles to both graphic design and interactivity.

            <p>Learned C and UNIX operating system early in life, and was a CS major at UC Riverside before deciding to pursue Cognitive Science more broadly. In grad school, while finishing my dissertation on saccadic eye movements and attention, I simultaneously was co-owner and primary coder of a small web development company. Currently well-versed in standard web-design tools: HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript. I enjoy implementing complex animation both through Javascript/CSS integration, and HTML/CANVAS. I also am proficient with eye-tracking-, experimental design-, and statistics software.

        <div class='communication column'>
            <div>Communication</div>
            <p>Twenty years of University teaching in Cognitive Science including Memory and Cognition, Sensation and Perception, Biological Psychology, Philosophy of Mind, Evolutionary Psychology, Research Methods, and undergrad and grad Statistics. My classes have ranged from small seminars to those including over 400 students. I enjoy public speaking! - I have authored numerous published manuscripts and write clearly and effectively, in both technical and non-technical contexts.
