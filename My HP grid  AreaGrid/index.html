            <p>Twenty years expertise in attention, saccadic eye movements, visual and auditory perception, and the evolution of human behavior and consciousness. My dissertation examined the relationship between attention and eye movements; subsequent publications have examined the effect on eye-gaze location on auditory speech processing, etc.. University of California trained in all aspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistical analysis, and scientific communication. I integrate these principles with regard to both aethetic and interactive design. </p>

            <p>Pre-internet, I learned a number of programming languages including FORTRAN, PASCAL, and eventually C (including UNIX) and was a Computer Science major before shifting toward Cognitive Science more broadly. Post-internet, was co-owner and primary coder of a small web development company while attending graduate school. Currently well-versed in standard web-design tools: HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript. However my proficiencies and aptitude lean toward creating complex animation through Javascript/CSS integration, and with HTML-Canvas. Am also proficient with eye-tracking-, experimental design-, and statistics software.</p>

            <p>Over twenty years I've taught over 300 University courses, mostly in Cognitive Science, including Memory and Cognition, Sensation and Perception, Biological Psychology, Philosophy of Mind, Evolutionary Psychology, as well as Research Methods and grad Statistics. My classes have ranged from small seminars to those including over 400 students. I absolutely enjoy public speaking. I have published numerous rigorously peer-reviewed manuscripts and write clearly and effectively, in both technical and non-technical contexts.</p>
