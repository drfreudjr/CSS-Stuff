            <p>Twenty years expertise researching attention, saccadic eye movements, visual and auditory perception, and the evolution of human behavior and consciousness. My dissertation examined the relation between attention and eye movements; subsequent publications have examined the effect on eye-gaze location on auditory speech processing, etc.. University of California trained in all aspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistical analysis, and scientific communication. I integrate these principles with regard to both aesthetic and interactive aspects of design. </p>

            <p>As a youth I learned BASIC, FORTRAN, PASCAL, and C (including UNIX), and was a Computer Science major before my interests shifted toward Cognitive Science more broadly. While attending graduate school, resumed my interest in coding, and was co-owner and sole architect of a small web development company. Currently well-versed in standard web-design tools: HTML, CSS, and particularly Javascript. Proficiencies and aptitude lean toward physics-based animation with Javascript/CSS/HTML-Canvas integration. Well-versed with eye-tracking-, experimental design-, and statistical analysis software.</p>

            <p>Taught nearly 200 University courses and delivered thousands of lectures in Cognitive Science, including Memory and Cognition, Sensation and Perception, Biological Psychology, Philosophy of Mind, Evolutionary Psychology, as well as Research Methods and Graduate Statistics. My classes have ranged from small seminars to those including over 400 students, and I thoroughly enjoy public speaking. I have published numerous rigorously peer-reviewed manuscripts, and write clearly and effectively in both technical and non-technical contexts.</p>
