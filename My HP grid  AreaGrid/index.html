            <p>Trained at the University of California Santa Cruz in allaspects of behavioral research: stimulus design, data collection, statistics, and scientific communication. Academic interests have focused on attention, saccadic eye movements, consciousness, and evolutionary approaches to human behavior. Technilogical interests have focused on applying these principles to both graphic design and web development incorporating machine learning.
